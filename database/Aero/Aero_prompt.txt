The database schema consists of 4 tables:

The Company table contains IDs and names of the airlines transporting passengers. 
The Trip table contains information on the schedule of flights: trip (flight) number, company (airline) ID, plane type, departure city, destination city, departure time, and arrival time. 
The Passenger table holds IDs and names of the passengers. 
The Pass_in_trip table contains data on flight bookings: trip number, departure date (day), passenger ID and her seat (place) designation during the flight. 

It should be noted that:
- scheduled flights are operated daily; the duration of any flight is less than 24 hours; town_from <> town_to;
- all time and date values are assumed to belong to the same time zone;
- departure and arrival times are specified with one minute precision;
- there can be several passengers bearing the same first name and surname (for example, Bruce Willis);
- the seat (place) designation consists of a number followed by a letter; the number stands for the row, while the letter (a â€“ d) defines the seat position in the grid (from left to right, in alphabetical order);
- connections and constraints are shown in the DBML schema below.
